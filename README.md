<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋</h1>

---

I'm **Sachin Chaudhary**, a 2nd-year CSE student from Uttarakhand University —  
still young in age but old in hustle.

My tech origin story started early.  
Back in **11th class**, while people were just learning Photoshop basics,  
I was already grinding as a **Full-Time Graphic Designer for 1.2 years**.  
Deadlines, creativity, clients — sab handle kiya.  
That phase carved discipline into me.  

Now the grind has evolved.

Today, I’m focused on building a strong engineering backbone  
through **Web Development** and **Data Structures & Algorithms** —  
the two pillars that make a developer unstoppable.
